![logo](docs/product.png)

##Description

The SolidFire PowerShell Tools is a collection of Microsoft速 Windows速 PowerShell functions that use SolidFire API to control a SolidFire storage system. These functions allow administrators to query for information, make changes to objects in a storage system, and develop complex scripts on a single platform. Users can implement this module with other modules and snap-ins, such as VMware速 PowerCLI and Cisco速 UCS PowerTool, to extend capabilities throughout the infrastructure.

Any user with a SolidFire storage system and Windows PowerShell can take advantage of the SolidFire PowerShell Tools. Users of the SolidFire PowerShell Tools should have an understanding of Windows PowerShell functions.

## Reporting
Provides scripts for reporting useful information from a SolidFire system.  Reports may also include scripts that report against other application or infrastructure components.

## SPBM
The SPBM functions extend capabilities by allowing administrators to implement vSphere Storage Policy Based Management dynamically. This leverages both the SolidFire PowerShell Tools and VMware PowerCLI.

## VMware
The scripts and functions in the VMware directory are directly related to managing SolidFire in a VMware environment.  This will include scripts to report on VM to volume mappings, creating policies, managing ESXi host to volume access group mappings, etc.  We will also include scripts for help with implementation of SolidFire best practices.

## Microsoft
