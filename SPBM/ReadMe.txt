I have compiled all of the functions into a module file, SolidFire-SPBM.psm1.  
Please provide updates and pull requests to the individual functions.  
I have a function that will roll all of the functions together into the module and incorporate updates.


# Version Note
These functions are built using SolidFire Tools for PowerShell 1.0RC.  
As such some parameter and property names may have changed slightly since the beta release.
These were necessary improvements to improve ease of use and consistency.
